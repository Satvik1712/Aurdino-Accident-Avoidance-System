# Aurdino-Accident-Avoidance-System
The accident-avoidance system helps to avoid the regular 
accidents that will normally occurring on highways and in city traffic. 
 
 This is an Arduino-based collision detection warning system. 
This kind of system is the fastest growing safety feature in 
automotive industries. Such a system enables vehicles to identify 
the chances of collision and give visual and audio warning to 
driver, so that the driver can take necessary action to avoid 
collision. 
The basic idea behind this project is to avoid accidents. It is a 
precautionary measure that alerts the driver. The initial stage begins 
from the ultrasonic sensor that identifies the vehicle in the front and 
back side. At distance between 80 to 40 meters yellow colour light 
will alerts us. When it reaches 40meter distance red colour light will 
alerts us we are in danger zone. At the same time the distance 
between one vehicle and another vehicle was displayed in LCD. Wire 
connections are made from the bread board to the LCD. Aurdino kit 
to the ultrasonic sensors and finally bread board to the aurdino kit. 
This project will make easy calculation of a distance between one 
vehicle and another vehicle for the driver
